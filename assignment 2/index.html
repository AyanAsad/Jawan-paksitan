        on the <em> Israel </em><abbr title="government">govt</abbr> to change its actions.<br>However, others worry that this boycott could harm innocent
       <em> Israeli</em> businesses and make it harder to find peace. It's important to understand both sides before deciding
        whether to <strong>boycott Israeli products</strong>. Being informed about the situation and the potential <cite>impacts of a boycott</cite>
        is crucial in making a thoughtful decision.
